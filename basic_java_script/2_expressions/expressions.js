/**
 * Operator Precedence
The precedence of operators determines the order they are applied when evaluating an expression. You can override operator precedence by using parentheses.

The precedence of operators, from lowest to highest is as follows:

comma ,
assignment = += -= *= /= %= <<= >>= >>>= &= ^= |=
conditional ?:
logical-or ||
logical-and &&
bitwise-or |
bitwise-xor ^
bitwise-and &
equality == !=
relational < <= > >=
bitwise shift << >> >>>
addition/subtraction + -
multiply/divide * / %
negation/increment ! ~ - ++ --
call, member () [] .
